** Load SchemaCrawler configuration from the classpath and file
Shell Command:
config-file

SchemaCrawler configuration reads a resource called schemacrawler.config.
properties from the CLASSPATH, which includes the lib/ folder. You can modify
the default settings in this file.

The order of loading configuration settings is:
1. From a CLASSPATH resource called schemacrawler.config.properties
2. Which can be overridden by settings in a configuration file (see below)
3. Which can be overridden by other command-line options

Command-line options will override configuration file options.

Options:
  -g, --config-file=<configfile>
         Read SchemaCrawler configuration properties from <configfile>
         <configfile> is the full path to the configuration file
         Optional, uses the default schemacrawler.config.properties file in the
           current directory, or in-built default options
