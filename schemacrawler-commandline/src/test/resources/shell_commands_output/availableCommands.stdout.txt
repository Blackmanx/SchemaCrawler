Available SchemaCrawler Commands:
 brief          Shows basic schema information, for tables, views and routines,
                  columns, primary keys, and foreign keys
 count          Shows counts of rows in the tables
 details        Shows maximum possible detail of the schema, including
                  privileges, and details of privileges, triggers, and check
                  constraints
 dump           Shows data from all rows in the tables
 list           Shows a list of schema objects
 quickdump      Shows data from all rows in the tables, but row order is not
                  guaranteed - this can be used with a minimum info-level for
                  speed
 schema         Shows the commonly needed detail of the schema, including
                  details of tables, views and routines, columns, primary keys,
                  indexes, foreign keys, and triggers
 test-command   Test command which is not deployed with the release
 <query_name>   Shows results of query <query_name>, as specified in the
                  configuration properties file
 <query>        Shows results of SQL <query>
                The query itself can contain the variables ${table}, ${columns}
                  and ${tabletype}, or system properties referenced as
                  ${<system-property-name>}
                Queries without any variables are executed exactly once
                Queries with variables are executed once for each table, with
                  the variables substituted

Notes:
- For help on an individual SchemaCrawler command,
  run SchemaCrawler with options like: `-h command:schema`
  or from the SchemaCrawler interactive shell: `help command:schema`
- Options for the commands should be provided with the `execute` command
