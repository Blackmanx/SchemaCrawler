** Load database metadata into memory using a chain of catalog loaders
Shell Command:
load

Options:
      --attributes-file=<attributes-file>
                            Path to a YAML file with table and column
                              attributes to add to the schema
  -i, --info-level=<infolevel>
                            <infolevel> is one of unknown, minimum, standard,
                              detailed, maximum
                            The info level determines the amount of database
                              metadata retrieved, and also determines the time
                              taken to crawl the schema
                            Optional, defaults to standard
      --infer-extension-tables
                            Infers extension tables that have similarly named
                              primary keys, and reports them as weak
                              associations
                            Optional, defaults to false
      --load-row-counts     Loads row counts for each table
                            This can be a time consuming operation
                            Optional, defaults to false
      --no-empty-tables     Includes only tables that have rows of data
                            Requires table row counts to be loaded
                            Optional, default is false
      --test-load-option    Check that the test option is added to the load
                              command
      --weak-associations   Analyzes the schema to find weak associations
                              between tables, based on table and column naming
                              patterns
                            This can be a time consuming operation
                            Optional, defaults to false

For additional options, specific to individual catalog loaders,
run SchemaCrawler with: `-h loaders`
or from the SchemaCrawler interactive shell: `help loaders`
