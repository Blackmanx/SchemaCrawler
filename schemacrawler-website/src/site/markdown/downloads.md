## Distributions and Downloads

SchemaCrawler is distributed in a variety of ways, to support various use cases.

If you would like to use SchemaCrawler without installing it, you can explore the SchemaCrawler command-line with a live tutorial on [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/schemacrawler). The Katacoda tutorial works from within any browser with no software or plugins needed.

If you need to use SchemaCrawler locally, you have a number of options. You can [download SchemaCrawler releases with tutorials from GitHub.](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler/releases). You can install the SchemaCrawler Interactive Shell using platform-specific installers downloaded from [schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Installers](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Installers). For Windows, SchemaCrawler is also available via the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/packages/schemacrawler), as well as via [Microsoft Windows Package Manager, winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/).

If you want to use SchemaCrawler as a library, and in your build, all jars are in the [Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:us.fatehi%20a:schemacrawler*). They can be used as dependencies in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) projects, or with any other build system that supports the Central Repository. SchemaCrawler reports can be incorporated into Apache Maven builds with the [SchemaCrawler Report Maven Plugin](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Report-Maven-Plugin) and into the GitHub Actions workflow with the [SchemaCrawler Action](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Action).

Pre-packaged Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/schemacrawler/schemacrawler/) are on Docker Hub.

Additional SchemaCrawler database plugins are available from the [schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Database-Plugins](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler-Database-Plugins) project.
