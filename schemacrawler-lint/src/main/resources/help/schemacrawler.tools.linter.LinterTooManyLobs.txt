Checks for tables that have too many large objects (CLOBs or BLOBs), since these could result in additional reads when returning query results. By default, this is more than one such column.
Example configuration:

```yaml
- id: schemacrawler.tools.linter.LinterTooManyLobs
  config:
    max-large-objects: 3
```
